## What is Septure?

Septure helps you to keep track of all the series you've ever watched. Just like the title of the app suggests, it captures your series. With Septure you'll never lose track of those awesome series you've watched but probably would forget about without this app.

## Features

- [ ] Overview of all the series you've watched including their seasons and episodes
- [ ] Easily add seasons and episodes to your *watched* list with autocompleted searching
- [ ] Reminds you when a new season of your series is going to be aired
